  <h2>📖 Passage (Chapter 1 – “The Sound of the Shell”)</h2>
  <p>Ralph stood, prim and proper, a golden boy under the sunlight, looking out over the beach and the lagoon. The air was hot and still, broken only by the sound of waves lapping gently at the shore. He lifted his chin, feeling the sea breeze move across his face.</p>
  <p>Behind him, Piggy panted up the sand, adjusting his glasses with a sniff.</p>
  <p>“Aren’t there any grownups at all?” Piggy asked, looking nervously around the dense trees and the empty beach.</p>
  <p>Ralph grinned. “No grownups!” he said with delight.</p>
  <p>Piggy was not amused. “What are we going to do? Who’s going to look after us?”</p>
  <p>“We’ll have fun,” Ralph said. “This is like an adventure story. A treasure island.”</p>
  <p>Piggy frowned and looked back toward the forest. “We need to find the others.”</p>
  <p>Ralph nodded. “Let’s find the others. Maybe someone’s got a trumpet or something.”</p>
  <p>Piggy looked at Ralph’s hand. “What’s that?”</p>
  <p>“A conch,” said Ralph. “I found it in the water.”</p>
  <p>“You could blow it,” Piggy said. “Like a trumpet. That’ll bring them.”</p>
  <p>Ralph raised the shell to his lips and blew. The sound rang out over the beach, strange and wild.</p>
